Forgiveness, grace and salvation are core to the teachings of the Adventist church. Adventists believe in the second-coming of Jesus Christ, as outlined in the Gospels.</p><h4>ARE YOU CHRISTIANS?</h4><p>Most definitely. We share a set of beliefs common with all Christians, such as: The Holy Trinity – Seventh-day Adventists accept the traditional position, of three equal persons in the one Godhead. We believe in the Virgin birth and that Jesus was fully God and fully man. It’s a paradox that most Christians have to face up to.<br>Seventh-day Adventists accept the Bible from Genesis to Revelation as the inspired Word of God. They do not accept verbal inspiration – it is the meaning rather than the actual words or letters, that is inspired.<br>The Cross – Seventh-day Adventists accept that the cross was the full and complete sacrifice for sin.</p><h4>SO WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES?</h4><p>As with any denomination there are differences. For example we believe that God has given us free will – we don’t accept predestination. We believe that those who have died remain asleep until the Second Coming. If the dead are unconscious then obviously we can’t accept spiritualism and many New Age beliefs. We also believe strongly that Jesus will return to this earth in the near future.<br>But the belief which makes us really stand out, though it is not the most important part of our faith, is our belief that Saturday is the Sabbath. We believe that God gave us the seventh-day Sabbath when He first created the world. He put a special blessing on that particular day and we can still benefit from that blessing today. This is why you will find that Seventh-day Adventists all over the world attend church on a Saturday and do their best to keep it special.</p><h4>WORLD CHURCH</h4><p>Seventh-day Adventists can truly be regarded as a worldwide family of Christian believers. The Adventist presence manifests itself in nearly every country of the globe. Administratively, the church is served through its 13 regional areas of the world. No matter where you find a Seventh-day Adventist believer, you will find them to adhere to the ideals described by the Bible and their lives illustrating both faith in God and the church’s commitment to the betterment of all human beings. The mission of the church places great emphasis on different aspects of human freedom and responsibility. These include: religious liberty and human rights, humanitarian aid and development, better lifestyles, health and wholeness, education and personal growth, as well as social issues and community involvement.</p><h4>SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS STAND FOR:</h4><blockquote><p>When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, “I am the light of the world.
