Longburn Adventist College provides a dynamic learning environment for children from Year 7 to Year 13\. Our academic, co-curricular and pastoral care programmes pave the way to create excellent opportunities for all of our students. We have created an environment where learning is stimulating, fun and challenging; an environment that enables each child to LEARN and GROW in GOD. There are endless opportunities to explore and participate, where students are happy, safe, valued and respected. If you are looking for a school that encourages personal excellence, nurtures growth and focuses on holistic education; a place where students don't just attend, they belong... then look no further.
