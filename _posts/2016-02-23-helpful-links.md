#### HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS BELIEVE?

The Adventist belief system is based on the Bible. Forgiveness, grace and salvation are core to the teachings of the Adventist church. Adventists believe in the second-coming of Jesus Christ, as outlined in the Gospels.

#### ARE YOU CHRISTIANS?

Most definitely. We share a set of beliefs common with all Christians, such as: The Holy Trinity -- Seventh-day Adventists accept the traditional position, of three equal persons in the one Godhead. We believe in the Virgin birth and that Jesus was fully God and fully man. It's a paradox that most Christians have to face up to.  
Seventh-day Adventists accept the Bible from Genesis to Revelation as the inspired Word of God. They do not accept verbal inspiration -- it is the meaning rather than the actual words or letters, that is inspired.  
The Cross -- Seventh-day Adventists accept that the cross was the full and complete sacrifice for sin.

#### SO WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES?

As with any denomination there are differences. For example we believe that God has given us free will -- we don't accept predestination. We believe that those who have died remain asleep until the Second Coming. If the dead are unconscious then obviously we can't accept spiritualism and many New Age beliefs. We also believe strongly that Jesus will return to this earth in the near future.  
But the belief which makes us really stand out, though it is not the most important part of our faith, is our belief that Saturday is the Sabbath. We believe that God gave us the seventh-day Sabbath when He first created the world. He put a special blessing on that particular day and we can still benefit from that blessing today. This is why you will find that Seventh-day Adventists all over the world attend church on a Saturday and do their best to keep it special.

#### WORLD CHURCH

Seventh-day Adventists can truly be regarded as a worldwide family of Christian believers. The Adventist presence manifests itself in nearly every country of the globe. Administratively, the church is served through its 13 regional areas of the world. No matter where you find a Seventh-day Adventist believer, you will find them to adhere to the ideals described by the Bible and their lives illustrating both faith in God and the church's commitment to the betterment of all human beings. The mission of the church places great emphasis on different aspects of human freedom and responsibility. These include: religious liberty and human rights, humanitarian aid and development, better lifestyles, health and wholeness, education and personal growth, as well as social issues and community involvement.

#### SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS STAND FOR:

> When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." [John 8:12 (NIV)][0]
> 
> "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him." [John 3:16-17 (NIV)][1]
> 
> "Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am." [John 14:1-3 (NIV)][2]
> 
> They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. "Men of Galilee," they said, "why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven." [Acts 1:10-11 (NIV)][3]
> 
> According to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. [1 Thessalonians 4:15-17 (NIV)][4]
> 
> "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labour and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God."  
> [Exodus 20:8-10 (NIV)][5]
